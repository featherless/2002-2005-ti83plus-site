<b>Yamir Hernandez</b>-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a 13 year old programmer. I mostly Program in TI83 Basic and beginning
to learn ASM. I know HTML and currently learning Visual Basic. I have been programming for 1½ years but I am
still learning other languages. I'm in a school band playing the Saxophone, and i enjoy building computers as
much as I love using them.<br>

I'm a 15 year old programmer.  I mostly program in TI-83 Plus BASIC but I'm getting bored
of it so I'm learning C++ (A 22 year old programming language that is much more
complete).  I also program in pocketC (it's a pocket pc programming language which
is like c++).  I also have a TI-86 calc but BASIC is even slow on it so I don't
program on it.  My favorite music is Techno.  If I'm not programming, I'm with my
friends or playing computer games.  I hope to learn a whole bunch of C++ and make
a 3d game of some kind.  I don't know for sure but I probably won't be able to do much
more TI-83 Plus programming once I learn a lot about C++.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a 14 year old programmer.  I have taught myself HTML and TI83 Basic,
SOME Ti83 ASM, C++, Pascal, and HEX (very little...).  I excel in math,
and am in Jazz band, Band, Swimming, and tennis.  I have been doing
Calculator programming for one year, ever since I saw my cousin
making a dumb calculator virus!  You can download more games I made
from my website: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ti83expert">ti83expert</a>.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Josh Rodasti and I am 15 years old. As you
have noticed my name has been mentioned on the site, and you probably already know what I
do. I am Jeff’s image artist for most of his games. One of them is the famous Raging Flame.
My favorite hobby is drawing. Sometimes I will just rent an anime movie and see how they
drew the characters! You probably already knew I liked to draw, so my other hobbies include
soccer, singing, band (jazz band, concert band, any others), choir (cliff avenue, cadet),
and video games (given).<p>
<b>Jeff Verkoeyen</b>-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been programming the TI83+ since I got it, two
years ago for Christmas.  So far, I have programmed many games (most of which are RPG's)
and many programs.  I am 14 years old, soon to be 15 and I have taught myself 7 different
languages- HTML, JavaScript, some Java and C++, CSS, ASP, and TIBASIC.  I excel
in math, english, and science courses, and I am currently studying Geometry on my own, outside
of class.  I technically know 9 different languages, if you count English and French in there
too, lol.  My favorite sports are Basketball, Soccer, and Baseball, and I also love biking in
the summer.  During the winter, I love to ski and do it as often as I can.  Some other basic
information about myself is that I love programming, and hope to go to DigiPen, Institute of
Technology, or MIT, and get a major in computer programming (if there is such thing).<p>

<p>All of the above people (5 so far in the team), have been either programming 
with the calculator, drawing on it, or just plain messing with it for at least one full 
year.  If you would like to join the team, E-mail Jeff at the link to the side, and send 
at least one program or .gif screen shot if you would like to join the program/game team.
If you would like to join the site development team, then just email me and I will try to
write back as soon as I can.<p>
