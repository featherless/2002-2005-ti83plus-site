To all you fans of Raging Flame, I am truly sorry, but I am no longer going to work
on Raging Flame for the calculator.  I have "moved on" I guess you could say, from the
calculator to making RPG's on the computer instead.  I am giving anyone who wants to,
permission to edit/change this game if they want, but always link back to me, or I'll
hunt you down.<p>
Hey everyone, welcome to the link off of the PDS (Project Development Site) which is
completely dedicated to the Raging Flame Trilogy.  I will be posting back here with
more news and updates as to what is going on.

First part of Raging Flame's world map, I'll be updating piece-by-piece-<br>

Here is the first town in the game- Tulin, which is so far completely finished, I
just need to program in the shop, and then i'll start working on the other 1033
screens (it'll be quite easy using the sub-routines i've invented, which run extremely
fast and effectively) This map is actually 3x3 screens, but I compiled them all into
one big picture.<br>
