Hey everyone, I'm doing my annual check up on the TI Project Development Site, and I've decided that since
I no longer manage the website too often, I am looking for a new person to run the site.  If you have any
interest in running the TI Project Development Site, please contact me at the email on the left side of
the page.  You will have full access rights to managing all of the TI Project Development Site and I will
help you as much as possible with any web development.<p>
Here are the things you will need to do to manage this website:<br>
<ul>
 <li>Be dedicated to updating the site at least monthly
 <li>Know basic html skills.  The entire site was designed in HTML when I was in 8th grade, so the code's
     a bit rusty.
 <li>Know how to use the TI83+ profficiently.
</ul>
You will get full FTP access to TIProject.TheJeffFiles.com and you will be able to be in constant
contact with me via msn as I am on almost all the time.<br>
So hurry up!  Write to me before the position gets filled!

The TIProject Development Site has been moved over to TheJeffFiles.com, as it is a much bigger server
and allows a lot more bandwidth than brinkster (and it's a shorter name).  It is being hosted as a
subdomain as follows:  tiproject.TheJeffFiles.com

Well, bad news about brinkster now, evidently they've found the urge to start having to put ads on
their hosted sites :(.  Sorry everyone, but the Ad-free TIPDS will now be forced to have ads on it,
it's not my choice, so please don't direct any hate-mail at me, send it to brinkster about starting
placing ads on sites or something........

Hey again everybody, it's Jeff visiting back yet again.  I'd like to say thank you VERY much for all
of those who email me asking questions, I love hearing input from the fans of the TIPDS.  I would just
like to say that I believe that this site is truly a work from my heart, and without the support of
those who give feedback, this site could not have developed to what it is today.  Again, I would like
to thank everyone who has visited this site in the past year of operation!  Thanks everyone!

Wow, hey everyone, it's been a VERY long time since I've updated this site, hehe.  Sorry to everyone
here about that, I've been really busy with a new development time that I'm a part of, called
The Developer's Alliance.  <a href="http://TheDevelopersAlliance.com/">Link to the site</a>. At TDA,
we have recently finished our first game, Escape From the Funky Factory, and are starting on a new
one, which is requiring a LOT of work, so I haven't really been working on TI83+ stuff recently.
I would like to thank everyone who has been emailing me, I love hearing feedback about the site, and
if you ever have a question on anything TI83+ related, just ask me and I'll get back to you as quick
as I can.  One note on the bad-side, about 6 or 7 months ago, my computer's harddrive was wiped,
therefor clearing every single one of the calculator programs that I've ever created, so I lost most
of the new Raging Flame engine and such, but most of the stuff is recreatable, I just haven't really
had the will to do so recently, and I'm also developing video games for the computer now, so I guess
I've moved on, heh.  Have fun with the games!

HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!!  It's the new year, and that means a whole nother year of
game programming is ahead :)  Note to all the developers of the TIPDS, I will be posting
any of your new programs soon, I'm in Canada right now for X-mas, actually, I'm at the science
center as we speak!  So, I'll sign off now, keep on gaming!

Hey everyone, I have just received a package in the mail from Washington D.C.!!  It is
a recommendation and congratulations for making it in to the National Youth Leadership
Forum on Technology!  This will be held in Summer, 2003, in Silicon Valley itself!
So I'm probably going to be spending the next few months working on projects to show
there, so I'll have some really good games to show off :).  Hey, maybe they'll even like
one of 'em!  That would be cool.  Anyways, I probably won't update the site for a while,
sorry to all you calc fans.  But I have to start working hard to keep my grades up and
work on as many game projects as possible!  Till next time, have fun gaming!

The renovations are under-way and going fine.  I have updated the TIBASIC tips section
with a few good tips that will help you out a lot.  Also, I have made a lot of animated
GIF's for a few of the programs (so far Arcade, Memory, and TileFlip), so check 'em out
in the games section.  My next goal, for tomorrow, will be to fill in all of the empty
pictures in the programs archive.

Yet again, I'm going to do some renovations of the site.  I have made quite a few new
programs that haven't gotten uploaded to the site yet, so you'll probably see
about 10 more programs/games and updates to games on the site.  Also, I'm going to
add some things to make it easier to browse the archive (For Example, just click the
letter of the program you want to go to, etc).  If you have any ideas to send to
me, just send them to the email on the left, or post on the feedback board.  I will
also be personally testing each and every individual file, to make sure that they
work and are updated/easy to run.

Added a new link on the left (TIBASIC tips).  It should help mostly
everyone who has or does program in BASIC.

I have just finished making an algorithm for a new memory game, there is almost infinite
tiles you can play on, and it'll take a long time to finish (it has a save feature).

<b>Updates for: Wednesday, October 23, 2002 (later that night</b><br>
YAY! I got everything updated, after about 1 hour of work, remaking the whole site (well, you won't notice any difference,
but actually, I just compacted the whole site in to about half the original space! hehe, I love ASP)
Also, I've gotten all of the games uploaded that I have.  Oh! We also have a new person being
recruited to the team, called "Caleb S.".  Once he gets me his bio and etc, I'll have his stuff on the site, also.
That's all again, and 'till next time, have fun gaming!
